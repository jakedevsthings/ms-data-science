For Milestone 1, select a topic that interests you. Then come up with 5 questions/theories about this topic. You could also come up with a question that you are interested in solving or proving and then come up with a total of 5 questions of research. Refer to the term project details for an example.

After completing your Google Trends analysis on your topic, you must provide a 500-word paper that includes an Introduction, Summary of your Research (along with visual aids) and a conclusion where you highlight the area of research you now want to continue looking into after this initial pass of research.
