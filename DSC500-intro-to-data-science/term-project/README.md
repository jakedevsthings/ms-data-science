You will have a term project during this course that has 4 milestones. This project will be a combination of research and analysis. There is no coding required as part of this assignment.

The summary of the project is to come up a question/theory/topic that you research via multiple sources, including search engine data. You must identify additional data sources (or identify what data NEEDS to be collected), then present your findings to your peers on your analysis process. Your peers will then provide feedback like a SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) to give you feedback on how to improve your analysis.

The project does not require you to complete or actually prove out the theory or answer the question, but you will gain experience asking the questions necessary and starting the research required in order to complete the project.
