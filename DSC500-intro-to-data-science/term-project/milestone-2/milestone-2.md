Continue researching your topic and gather supporting (or disproving information) about your topic. Expand on your paper from Milestone 1 and start including the information you have found with your additional research. For example, if your topic is to determine if social media makes people depressed, you might include that you need to investigate social media use correlated to suicide and depression searches or find medical studies to indicate a connection. This is very basic; I expect you to thoroughly think through your idea and what it would require to prove or disprove your theory or question. Ask yourself what you would do if someone told you a fact that you didn’t believe to be true – how would you go about disproving it?

A very key component to this research and analysis might be how you would go about collecting data if it doesn’t currently exist. In my sunscreen example – I likely would need to get myself to the beach and start interviewing people! Is that realistic? How do you get a large enough population? What do the sunscreen companies do when they research effectiveness or potential side effects? These are just examples of the thought process and line of questioning I need to take for my sunscreen topic.

The objective for this milestone is to keep asking questions. Asking questions is going to be expected of you as a data scientist. You want to keep peeling back the layers of the onion until you have exhausted your efforts.

At this point, I expect the following sections to be included in your draft paper:

Introduction\
Overview of Topic/Problem\
Analysis (This should include all the areas of research and questions you have explored)\
Findings/Next Steps\
Conclusion\
Sources

You must have at least 5 different sources of research, which you can cite at the end of your paper in APA format. This paper should now be between 1000-1500 words.
