## Probability Theory
Probability theory studies randomness. We define a **sample space** of all outcomes, assign each outcome a **probability** between 0 and 1, and use rules like addition and multiplication to find the chance of events. 
Independent events don't affect each other. Conditional probability updates chances when we know extra info. Expected value is the long run average payoff if we repeated a random process many times.

```{r}
# 1) How many different license plates can be made from six digits?
license_plates <- 10^6 # 10 choices per digit, 6 positions
# e.g. (0123456789)(0123456789)(...)(...)(...)(...)

# 2) When flipping a coin, what is the probability you will get heads three times in a row?
p_hhh <- (1 / 2)^3 # independent flips

# Build a simple visualization of all 8 sequences, highlight HHH
seqs <- c("HHH", "HHT", "HTH", "HTT", "THH", "THT", "TTH", "TTT")
probs <- rep(1 / 8, length(seqs)) # fair coin, all sequences equally likely
cols <- ifelse(seqs == "HHH", "tomato", "lightgray")

# Draw bar chart
op <- par(mar = c(6, 4, 2, 1)) # more space for x labels
barplot(
    probs,
    names.arg = seqs,
    col = cols,
    ylim = c(0, max(probs) * 1.2),
    main = "Probability of Each 3-Flip Sequence (HHH highlighted)",
    ylab = "Probability"
)
par(op)

# 3) Given a standard 52 card deck of cards, what is the probability you’ll randomly draw an Ace of Spades and then Two of Hearts in a row?
p_aceofspaces_twoofhearts <- (1 / 52) * (1 / 51)

# 4) Dice: given first die is 6, P(sum = 9) means second die must be 3
p_sum9_given_first6 <- 1 / 6

# 5) Investment expected value
ev_invest <- 0.30 * 70000 + 0.70 * (-40000) # dollars

# 6) Lottery expected value (per $2 ticket)
# Prizes: 1 x 200,000; 5 x 1,000; 15 x 300; 25 x 10; total tickets = 5,000,000
total_tix <- 5e6
expected_winnings <- (1 * 200000 + 5 * 1000 + 15 * 300 + 25 * 10) / total_tix
expected_net <- expected_winnings - 2 # subtract ticket cost
